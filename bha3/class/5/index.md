## Synopsys

This week we will start working with DNA, the fundamental building block of life. In the lecture you will learn all about 

## Schedule

* Genetics
* Biomaterials
* Thermocycler, Gel box and power supply Design
* Practicals
  * [DNA extraction](/bha3/class/5/DNA-extraction/)
  * [DNA profiling](http://bio-rad.com/en-us/product/forensic-dna-fingerprinting-kit)
  * [Cloning](http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/product/pglo-bacterial-transformation-kit)

## Devices

For this week's practicals we need 3 devices:

### Thermocycler

We have started to design our own thermocycler, but there are already so many Open Source designs out there, you may also choose own of those. Such as the [OpenPCR](http://www.openpcr.org), [Wild Open PCR](http://hackteria.org/wiki/Wild_OpenPCR) and [NinjaPCR](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/ninjapcr)

### Gelbox

Well, a Gelbox is exactly what the name tells you: a box. The only special features are two wires on each side. Make sure you use an inert material like platinum, gold, carbon or stainless steel for it, otherwise the electrodes will oxidize like crazy.

### Power supply

Completely open source, perfectly suitable: [IO Rodeo Power Supply](http://www.iorodeo.com/content/electrophoresis-power-supply-kit)

## Bill of Materials

In order to take part in this class you will need the following materials:

* [Thermocycler materials](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Thermocycler/blob/master/BoM.md)
* [Gelbox materials](https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_GelBox/blob/master/BoM.md)

## Additional reading and hacking

* ThermoCycler
  * [OpenPCR](http://www.openpcr.org)

## Feeling lazy?

Go ahead and buy a thermocycler:

* [BioRad PCR machines](http://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/category/pcr-instrumentation)
